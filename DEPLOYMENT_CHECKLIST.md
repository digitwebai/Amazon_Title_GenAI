# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Repository Setup
- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] `.gitignore` file exists and excludes sensitive files
- [ ] No `.env` files are committed to the repository
- [ ] `app.py` is in the root directory

### 2. File Configuration
- [ ] `requirements.txt` contains all dependencies
- [ ] `.streamlit/config.toml` is properly configured
- [ ] No hardcoded `localhost` addresses in config

### 3. Environment Variables
- [ ] OpenAI API key is NOT in the code
- [ ] Ready to set API key in Streamlit Cloud

## 🔧 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Go to Streamlit Cloud
1. Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account

### Step 2: Create New App
1. Click **"New app"**
2. Select your repository
3. Set **Branch** to `main` (or your default branch)
4. Set **Main file path** to `app.py`
5. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
**CRITICAL**: After deployment, you MUST set the API key:

1. Go to your app's **Settings**
2. Scroll down to **"Secrets"** section
3. Add this configuration:
```toml
[openai]
api_key = "your_actual_openai_api_key_here"
```

**OR** use environment variables:
1. Go to **"Advanced settings"**
2. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Set value to your actual OpenAI API key

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. After setting the API key, click **"Redeploy"**
2. Wait for the build to complete

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: This is usually a configuration issue, not a port issue.
- ✅ **Fixed**: Removed `address = "localhost"` from `.streamlit/config.toml`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated `requirements.txt` with compatible versions

### Issue: "Module not found"
**Solution**: 
- Check that all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Use `>=` instead of `==` for version numbers
- Ensure package names are correct

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not found"
**Solution**:
- Set the API key in Streamlit Cloud secrets
- Make sure you're using the correct API key format
- Check that the key has sufficient credits

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**:
- Check the build logs in Streamlit Cloud
- Ensure `app.py` is in the root directory
- Verify all imports are correct

## 📋 File Structure for Deployment

```
your-repo/
├── app.py                 # Main Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
├── .streamlit/
│   └── config.toml       # Streamlit config (no localhost)
├── data/                 # Sample data (optional)
└── README.md             # Documentation
```

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Test Locally First
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. Check Build Logs
- Go to your app in Streamlit Cloud
- Click on the build logs to see detailed error messages

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
- Check that API key is set correctly
- Ensure no typos in variable names

### 4. Test API Key
- Verify your OpenAI API key works with a simple test
- Check that you have sufficient credits

## 🎯 Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ App builds without errors
- ✅ App loads in the browser
- ✅ No "port already in use" errors
- ✅ OpenAI API connection works
- ✅ You can generate titles successfully

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. **Check the build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Test the API key** locally first
3. **Verify all files** are committed to GitHub
4. **Contact Streamlit support** if it's a platform issue

## 📞 Quick Test

Run this command to test your setup:
```bash
python test_deployment.py
```

This will verify that all components are ready for deployment.
